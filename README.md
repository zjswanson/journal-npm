## Description

Create a journaling website where a user can write entries including at least a title and body.

Create Entry objects that include a method to return the number of words in the entry.

Then, add a separate method (or methods) to return the number of vowels and consonants in each entry.

Call each of these methods from your front-end file to display their return values.

Finally, add a method called getTeaser to return the first sentence of the entry.

If the sentence is over 8 words, only display those first 8 words. Be sure to call this method from your front-end file to display the results as well, whenever a new journal entry is created.
